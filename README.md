# pronoun-badges
A repo for pronoun badge artwork to use at conferences &amp; events

Can be changed and remixed however people like

~I usually use: http://www.awesomemerchandise.com/32mm-Badges to order badges~ It seems that Awesome merchandise stopped doing round 32mm badges. 

These badge templates are currently using an old Awesome Merchandise template file with bleed for a 32mm round badge.

I'll be making some open file formats asap
