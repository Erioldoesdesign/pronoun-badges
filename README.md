# pronoun-badges
A repo for pronoun badge artwork to use at conferences &amp; events

Can be changed and remixed however people like

~I usually use: http://www.awesomemerchandise.com/32mm-Badges to order badges~ It seems that Awesome merchandise stopped doing round 32mm badges. Awesome Merchandise also stopped trading as a company. I recommend using STickerMule from now on: https://www.stickermule.com/uk/custom-buttons

Sticker Mule have a 32mm option for buttons here: https://www.stickermule.com/uk/products/1-25-inch-round-buttons

These badge templates are currently using an old Awesome Merchandise template file with bleed for a 32mm round badge. The Stickermule process doesn't have bleed/no bleed options for uploading artwork but as of 2024 the maintainer is going to check the print quality of the 32mm badges with bleed and the 57mm badges (https://www.stickermule.com/uk/products/2-25-inch-round-buttons) with bleed. The 57mm badge design will include a link to this repo to find the templates.

~I'll be making some open file formats asap~ I made some new versions that match Stickermule's templates in a SVG folder in this repo and added the old files into a PSD (Adbobe Photoshop) folder. There is also an AI (Adobe Illustrator) folder too!

The font used is 'GilbertBoldPreview4' (https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gilbert#fonts-section) and the colours are in CMYK so render odd in the github preview. The font was chosen as it is a special 'Pride' font created to honor the memory of Gilbert Baker, the creator of the iconic Rainbow Flag. More info here: https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/gilbert#about-section. You can download this font from this website https://www.typewithpride.com/download/.
